# Where are the information coming from?

This is a mixed list of manually massaged information from below sites:

- The list of CIDR comes from
  [Free IP2Location Firewall List by Search Engine](https://www.ip2location.com/free/robot-whitelist)

  I've obtained the `Apache .htaccess allow` file format and hand edited them to
  only have the CIDR on each line.

- The user-agent data comes from
  (https://www.rtcx.net/bot-list)[https://www.rtcx.net/bot-list]

  Only `Search Engine` are keep for this repo. Some CIDR not present on above
  source are added from here.
